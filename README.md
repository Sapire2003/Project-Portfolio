# Project-Portfolio
A collection of my projects that I have created over the years

Over my time at Union College I have worked on a lot of projects to enhance my skills in coding languages such as Python and Java.
Though never easy, I have always enjoyed the challenge and have worked in and out of class to get to where I am today.
