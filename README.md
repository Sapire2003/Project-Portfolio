# Project-Portfolio
A collection of projects on data analysis I have completed during my time at Union College.

Data scraping, information extraction, and charting data in new ways are the main programming
skills I have taken away from working on these projects.  Learning these new techniques has helped
me learn new ways to go about studying my works and improving in areas I don't understand.
